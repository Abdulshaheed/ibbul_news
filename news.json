The Niger State House of Assembly has called on the state governor to issue an executive order banning Marker's Day/Sign out celebrations in all secondary and tertiary institutions in the state. The motion, sponsored by Hon. Muhammad Sani Idris, highlights the negative consequences of these events, including unruly behavior, misconduct, and immoral activities.

Lawmakers supporting the motion argue that the celebrations have become a distraction from academic pursuits, with students prioritizing the events over their studies. They also expressed concern over the rising incidents of gangsterism, immoral acts, and bazaar-like activities associated with the celebrations.

The House has assured that it will follow up with the governor and the Ministry of Education to ensure the ban is enforced.",
